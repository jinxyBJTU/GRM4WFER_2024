These are the source code and experimental setups for the Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion (CASE) and Continuous Physiological and Behavioral Emotion Annotation Dataset for 360&deg; Videos (CEAP-360VR) datasets.

## Datasets
We evaluate our model on the CASE dataset and the CEAP-360VR dataset.
 - The CASE dataset is available [here](https://gitlab.com/karan-shr/case_dataset), and we provide the pipeline to run GRM4WFER on it.
 - The CEAP-360VR dataset is an open-access and collaborative database. Information on how to obtain it can be found [here](https://github.com/cwi-dis/CEAP-360VR-Dataset).
